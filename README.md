A basic script that just shows a backtest of the stock market anomaly known as the "payday anomaly."

**The idea:**
Many U.S. workers are paid on the 1st and 15th of the month. When they receive their paycheck, a portion of their paycheck is invested for retirement automatically if they are enrolled in some sort of retirement plan (ie. 401k). 
The retirement funds invest this money usually the following day. 
So theoretically, buying equities on the 2nd and 16th of the month could offer some positive, uncorrelated return.
